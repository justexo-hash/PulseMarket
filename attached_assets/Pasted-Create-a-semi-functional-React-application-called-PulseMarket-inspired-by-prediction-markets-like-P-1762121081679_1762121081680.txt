Create a semi-functional React application called Polymeme, inspired by prediction markets like Polymarket. The app will be a single-page application (SPA) that uses react-router-dom for navigation. It will display a list of markets, allow users to click for details, and simulate creating a new market.

🛠️ Tech Stack & Setup
Framework: React (using Hooks: useState, useEffect)

Routing: react-router-dom

You will need to install this in the Replit shell: npm install react-router-dom

Styling: A single App.css file.

Database: No backend needed. We will use a mock data file (src/mockData.js) to act as our database.

📋 Feature Requirements & Component Structure
1. Mock Data (src/mockData.js)
Create this file first. It will export an array of market objects.

JavaScript

// src/mockData.js
export const mockMarkets = [
  {
    id: 1,
    question: "Will Ethereum reach $5,000 by 2026?",
    category: "Crypto",
    probability: 65,
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    question: "Will 'Dune: Part Two' win Best Picture?",
    category: "Entertainment",
    probability: 22,
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    question: "Will AI surpass human intelligence by 2030?",
    category: "Technology",
    probability: 40,
  },
];
2. Main App Component (src/App.jsx)
This component will be the "brain" of your app.

Import mockMarkets and store them in state: const [markets, setMarkets] = useState(mockMarkets);

Set up react-router-dom (BrowserRouter, Routes, Route).

Include the Header component on all pages.

Define a function handleCreateMarket that takes a newMarket object and adds it to the markets state (e.g., setMarkets([...markets, newMarket]);).

3. Routing (src/App.jsx)
Set up the following routes:

/: Renders the MarketList component.

/markets/:id: Renders the MarketDetail component.

/create: Renders the CreateMarket component.

4. Components (src/components/)
Create a components folder in src.

Header.jsx

A simple navigation bar.

Shows the name "Polymeme".

Uses the Link component from react-router-dom to link to:

"Markets" (/)

"Create Market" (/create)

MarketList.jsx (Homepage)

Receives the markets array as a prop.

Maps over the array and renders a MarketCard component for each market.

MarketCard.jsx

A presentational component that receives a single market object as a prop.

Displays the question, category, and probability (e.g., "65%").

The entire card should be wrapped in a Link component that navigates to /markets/${market.id}.

MarketDetail.jsx

Uses the useParams hook from react-router-dom to get the id from the URL.

Receives the full markets array as a prop.

Finds the correct market: const market = markets.find(m => m.id === parseInt(id));

Displays the full market question.

Semi-functional: Shows two buttons: "Bet Yes" and "Bet No".

On click, these buttons just trigger a JavaScript alert('Your mock trade has been placed!');.

CreateMarket.jsx

Receives the handleCreateMarket function as a prop.

Uses useState to control a simple form with inputs for "Question" and "Category".

Uses the useNavigate hook from react-router-dom.

On form submit:

Prevents the default form action.

Creates a new market object (don't forget a new id!).

Calls the handleCreateMarket prop with the new object.

Uses Maps('/') to redirect the user back to the homepage.

🎨 Styling (src/App.css)
Theme: Modern dark mode.

body: background-color #1A1B2D, color white.

Font: Import "Inter" from Google Fonts at the top of your CSS file.

Accent Color: Use an electric purple/blue (e.g., #4A4AFF) for buttons, links, and highlights.

Header: Make it sticky at the top with a slight background color (e.g., #25263B).

Market Cards:

background-color: #25263B

border-radius: 8px

padding: 16px

box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)

Hover Effect: transform: scale(1.02); and transition: all 0.2s ease;

Use CSS Grid or Flexbox for the MarketList to create a responsive card layout.
